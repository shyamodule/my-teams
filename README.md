# my-teams

This is just a simple clone of Microsoft Teams which has minimal functionality of chat and video-calling feature. 
I have used Twilio Chat SDK and Twilio Video SDK for implementing these features.

For running this code, copy .env.example file to .env and replace the Twilio API credentials. 

Then, run "npm install" command in the command prompt in the project directory.

The above step will install all the dependencies to run the project.

Run "npm start" command and you are good to go.
